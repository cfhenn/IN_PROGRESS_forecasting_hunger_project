#forecasting_hunger_project

This project takes publicly-available data on temperature, precipitation, and nightlight intensity, and uses it to estimate month-to-month hunger in Malawi.

The data files used for this project are too large to store on GitHub, but are available from the following sources:

Climate (mean, max, & min temperature, precipitation):

https://chelsa-climate.org/

Nightlight intensity:

https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/eog/nighttime-lights/

Monthly hunger in Malawi:

< currently working on more detailed instructions for getting data / making the program work with it - contact me for if needed sooner >
